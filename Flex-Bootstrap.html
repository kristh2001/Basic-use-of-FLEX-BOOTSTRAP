                            The generative AI platform ChatGPT can now fetch data directly from the internet and 
                            gather up-to-date information in real-time, its creator OpenAI said Wednesday, in a 
                            major milestone for the software.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative 
                            information, complete with direct links to sources,” OpenAI said in a post on X, 
                            formerly Twitter. “It is no longer limited to data before September 2021.”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            OpenAI launched the update for its paying subscribers in June but suspended it after
                            users managed to bypass paywalls on internet content.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            OpenAI partner Microsoft, already offers Bing Chat, an integration of GPT-4, the language 
                            model used to develop ChatGPT, with its internet search engine, as does Google with its 
                            conversational robot Bard.ChatGPT will provide direct sources alongside its responses, 
                            which will no longer be based on the single database the program’s publisher controls.

                            The company responsible for Unity Engine, a pivotal game development tool widely employed by independent 
                            studios, has generated considerable controversy with the introduction of a new fee structure. Beginning on 
                            January 1st, Unity will implement charges for developers every time a game utilizing the engine is downloaded.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The newly introduced charge will come into effect once sales cross a revenue threshold of $200,000 within a 
                            12-month period and reach a total of 200,000 installations. The fee structure will vary depending on the 
                            developer's specific license agreement with Unity but may go as high as $0.20 per installation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This announcement has sparked outrage and disbelief within the game development community. Garry Newman, 
                            the creator of the immensely popular Garry's Mod, expressed his frustration on Twitter, questioning Unity's 
                            ability to unilaterally impose this tax per installation and the necessity to rely on their tracking. 
                            Indie developer Tony Gowland chimed in, emphasizing that they had already paid for their Pro licenses upfront, 
                            expecting that any subsequent revenue would belong to them, and this new backend tax introduced after two years
                            of development was unwelcome.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Unity unveiled this fee on its website, referring to it as the Unity Runtime Fee, in reference to the Unity Runtime 
                            code that executes each game on player devices, which had not been monetized until now. The company explained in a 
                            blog post that an install-based fee allows creators to continue benefiting financially from player engagement. 
                            Marc Whitten, President of Unity Create, discussed the new fee in an interview with the industry news site Game 
                            Developer, stating that Unity's goal is to achieve a more equitable value exchange between the company and developers
                            and to generate more revenue to further invest in the engine.
